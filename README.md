# StudySpace
> CP317 Team Project: A platform to help university students setup their own study spaces, and join existing ones!

## Structure
Documentation is present inside the `docs/` folder. This folder is further subdivided into different subcategories. For example `docs/specifications.md` will hold the specification document.

## On Versioning
At the end of every document, there'll be a Version History. This section details who worked on different versions of every document. Keep an eye out for this part!
