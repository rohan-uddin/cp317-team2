                Post-secondary students are the intended users of this product.
                As such, it is assumed that the user has experience using a web
                browser and navigating websites. It is helpful — but not
                necessary — for the user to have experience with common social
                media applications, such as Reddit, Instagram, or Twitter. This
                experience should aid the user in learning how certain features
                of StudySpace work, such as chat, due to the similarities to
                other social media applications.

                A large number of users must be able to access the website at

                responsive to the user, chat logs should update within a second
                whenever a user sends a chat.

                The website must be quick and responsive to all screens above
                320px in order to meet usability requirements. From the
                front-end perspective, content must load quickly and transitions
                between pages should be seamless. 95% of the transactions shall
                be processed in less than 1 second.

            <p>
                Any access to the StudySpace backend needs to be verified to
                ensure that only authorized administrators/moderators have
                access. Authorization involves entering a valid username and
                password to an account with administrator privileges. When an
                administrator or moderator logs into the system, they are
                granted permissions to edit, create, and delete content.

                web-capable and has a browser. Therefore, StudySpace must be
                compatible with any operating system, including Windows, MacOS
                and Linux. The product must also be compatible with any browser,
                including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Safari.
