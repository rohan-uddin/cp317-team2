        <h4 class="mume-header" id="21-product-perspective">2.1. Product Perspective</h4>

        <p>StudySpace is an independent, self-contained web application. Core features are personalized profiles, groups, chats and pages in each group. It is a web application with 2 components: user interfaces (front end), and software interfaces (back end).</p>
        <h5 class="mume-header" id="211-user-interfaces">2.1.1. User Interfaces</h5>

        <p><strong>Search bar</strong><br>
        StudySpace has a search bar along the top, icons to log in, and a home page with general information that appears upon entering the site. Users can use the search bar to navigate to groups that interest them.</p>
        <p><strong>Profile</strong><br>
        Once logged in, a user will see a link to their profile. This link remains present as the user navigates the website. On the left side of this page, users can view/edit their preferences and other personal information. On the right, there are two lists: a list of groups the user is a part of, and a list of users they are friends with. By clicking on one of the groups, the user is taken to the group page for that specific group. By clicking on one of the users, the user is taken to the profile page of that user. Since the users are friends, the friends&#x2019; profile page will contain a button near the top, labelled &#x201C;Message&#x201D;, which the User can click to send a direct chat to that friend.</p>
        <p><strong>Create new post</strong><br>
        On the group page, there is a button at the top that allows the user to create a new post. Taking up the centre of the group page is a list of titles corresponding to previously-published posts belonging to the group. The posts are sorted by popularity.</p>
        <p><strong>Full-screen view of the post</strong><br>
        Clicking on the title of a post brings the user to a page containing a full-screen view of the post, with the title and total number of upvotes/downvotes at the top, and the body of the post underneath. On either side of the upvotes/downvotes count are two arrow-shaped buttons; one pointing up and one pointing down. To upvote this post, the user must simply click the upward-pointing arrow. To downvote the post, the user must click the downward-pointing arrow. From this view, the responses to the post are also visible; they are displayed below the body of the original post. In between the body of the post and its responses, there is a textbox and a &#x201C;Reply&#x201D; button to the right of it. These features allow the user to submit a response to the post.</p>
        <p><strong>Chat box</strong><br>
        On the right-hand side of the group page is a chat box where members of the group can send text messages for others members to see.</p>
        <p><strong>User pop-up</strong><br>
        Any post, response, or chat displays a link which is the username of the user who sent/posted it. For posts, the username is displayed at the top next to the title. For responses and chat messages, the username of the sender is displayed directly above the body of the message. Clicking on the username brings the user to the profile of the user who sent/posted the item. Users can view the preferences and personal information of another user via their profile. While viewing another user&#x2019;s profile, a user also has the option to request to be their friend via a button in the top-right corner labelled &#x201C;Send Friend Request&#x201D;.</p>
        <p><strong>User match bar</strong><br>
        Along the left side of any group page is a list of user matches. User matches are based on the number of preferences two users have in common. Clicking on an entry in this list will bring the user to the profile of the matched user/suggested friend&#x2019;s page where they can send a friend request if they would like.</p>
        <h5 class="mume-header" id="212-software-interfaces">2.1.2. Software Interfaces</h5>

        <p>On the backend, clicking on groups, profiles, or posts sends a request to the database containing all information required by the site. The database must return said required information.</p>
        <p>The chat function is also handled by the backend.</p>
        <h4 class="mume-header" id="22-product-functions">2.2. Product Functions</h4>

        <p>Users can create their own group with a desired set of members or a specific topic. New groups may not share a name with existing groups. Users can create posts, comment on posts, chat, log in, and send friend requests to other users.</p>
        <p><strong>Private Group - Signed In Users</strong><br>
        Posts are only visible to users who have joined the group. Thus, users who have not joined the group cannot vote, comment on, or create any posts.</p>
        <p><strong>Private Group - Users Who Are Not Signed In</strong><br>
        Posts are not visible. Thus, users who have not signed in cannot vote or comment on any posts.</p>
        <p><strong>Public Group - Signed In Users</strong><br>
        Posts are visible to everyone. Users who have not joined the group may still view the   group&#x2019;s posts. Thus, any user can vote and comment on any posts. Any user could also make a post in the group.</p>
        <p><strong>Public Group - Users Who Are Not Signed In</strong><br>
        Posts are visible to everyone. Users who are not signed in can only view the posts. They cannot comment or vote.</p>
        <p><strong>Voting and Commenting On A Post</strong><br>
        All users, including the post&#x2019;s author, can upvote or downvote only once. Only users who are members of a private group can vote and comment on posts in said private group. All signed-in users can vote on posts and make comment(s) in a public group.</p>
        <h4 class="mume-header" id="23-user-characteristics">2.3. User Characteristics</h4>

        <p>Post-secondary students are the intended users of this product. As such, it is assumed that the user is educated and has experience using a web browser and navigating websites. It is helpful -but not necessary- for the user to have experience with common social media platforms, such as Reddit, Instagram, or Twitter. This experience should aid the user in learning how some features of StudySpace work, such as chat, due to the similarities to other social media.</p>
        <h4 class="mume-header" id="24-constraints">2.4. Constraints</h4>

        <p>A large number of users must be able to access the website at once. To ensure the website is reliable, smooth, and feels responsive to the user, chat logs should update within a second whenever a user sends a chat.</p>
        <h4 class="mume-header" id="25-assumptions-and-dependencies">2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>

        <p>It is assumed that users have a functioning, web-capable device with a browser installed. Users are expected to have an internet connection for the entire duration of their session. StudySpace should be compatible with any operating system and it does not matter whether a mobile device or desktop is used.</p>
        <h3 class="mume-header" id="3-specific-requirements">3. Specific Requirements</h3>

        <h4 class="mume-header" id="31-external-interface">3.1. External Interface</h4>

        </ul>
        <p>Posts</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Beside each post, there is an &#x201C;upvote&#x201D; or &#x201C;downvote&#x201D; icon.<br>
        Upvoting a post increases the total number of upvotes/downvotes by 1, and downvoting decreases the total by 1.</li>
        <li>Any user, including the author of the post, can only upvote or downvote a post once. The total number of upvotes/downvotes can be less than 0 if the number of downvotes exceeds the number of upvotes.</li>
        <li>Only loading in a small amount of posts initially. More posts will load as the user scrolls up.</li>
        <li>If no posts have been made to a group, a message is displayed which says, &#x201C;There are no posts here.&#x201D;</li>
        <li>When creating a post, there are requirements that must be met before it can be published. All posts need a title and at least one character of body text.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="mume-header" id="32-functions">3.2. Functions</h4>

        <p>Creating, editing, deleting post</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>User sign-in</p>
        <ul>
        <li>When users sign in, the email form must be in proper email format (eg; having &#x201C;@&#x201D; in their email address&#x201D;).</li>
        <li>There are no password requirements.</li>
        <li>Users stay logged in until they sign out.</li>
