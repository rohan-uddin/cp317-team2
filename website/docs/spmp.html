                <p>
                The objective of this project is to produce a web application that provides post-secondary students with several tools, including virtual groups for studying and networking with new peers. The main target audience for this product is post-secondary students. However, secondary target audiences include tutors, alumni, and anyone looking to buy or sell textbooks. The main objective is to complete all workflows of the project by their respective deadlines, as determined by the professor. The main priorities are quality of work and time efficiency. Budget is not a priority because there is no intention for any amount of money to be spent on this project.

                Each work activity has been scheduled in such a way that maximizes opportunities for different tasks to be done concurrently. Since each successive phase depends on having an established, agreed upon plan provided by the previous phases, it must be ensured that the next phase is never started before the deadline for SQA of the previous phase.

                <p>
                The resources used to complete the various work activities mentioned here include Google docs and GitHub. Google docs is used for writing the various drafts of each document and for the SQA team to make suggestions via the comment feature. GitHub is used to organize the documents and for general coordination of group processes.

                <p>
                Mechanisms used to measure progress and compare actual progress against planned progress include:
                </p>
                <ol>

                <li>Weekly group meetings on Discord held every Saturday. These weekly meetings are intended to allow for regular check-ins and to ensure that all task forces are working on schedule.

                <li>Meetings amongst group members who are working together on a given workflow; scheduled as necessary by the respective management team.

                <li>For each workflow, there are 3 group members who are assigned the management role. The managers take ownership of the workflow and are responsible for establishing deadlines, heading meetings, reviewing the final documentation, and monitoring the progress of the workflow. The managers of a workflow must communicate to the rest of the group when issues with scheduling or completion arise.

                <p>
                When actual progress doesn’t meet planned progress, corrective actions include:
                </p>
                <ol>

                <li>Making adjustments to scheduling to better suit the needs of the group members who require more time.

                <li>Assigning additional group members to the task that is demanding more time.

                <li>The management team responsible for the work devises an appropriate course of action that ensures everything gets done.
                </li>

                <p>
                Mechanisms used to control quality of work include:
                </p>
                <ol>

                <li>An SQA team assigned to each individual phase of the project to ensure all work done by the authors is correct, detailed, and conforms to the plans established in the previous phases. If there has been an update to the project scope or plan, it is the responsibility of the SQA team to ensure that the version control teams of previous phases are notified in the event that their phase requires modifications due to this update.

                <li>Each workflow has a version control team (3 people) responsible for updating the documentation of their assigned workflow whenever changes are made in successive phases that do not conform to the plans as laid out in their documentation.

                <li>The management team is responsible for reviewing the editing process done in response to suggestions made by the SQA team. Managers must ensure that all quality assurance suggestions/concerns are properly addressed.

                <li>All contributors to a phase — whether an author, SQA, or manager — must review the documentation from all previous phases prior to starting to work on their assigned phase. This is to ensure that all members are aware of plans, goals, and vision for their phase, which have been laid out by the past phases of the project.

                <li>Start with a schedule that all group members can agree is reasonable.

                <li>Aim to get each phase done at least a day before its due date so there is a time buffer if needed.

                <li>For the implementation phase especially, plan for things to go wrong; allocate extra time.

                <li>The management team for each phase is responsible for establishing deadlines, tracking progress, and ensuring work is completed on time.

                <li>Schedule enough time for more knowledgeable group members to guide others at first; anticipate a slow start as everyone learns.

                <li>Assign many group members to the SQA team and start SQA early on so that most bugs are identified while enough time is remaining for the programmers to actually fix them.

                <li>Make sure no programmer is given a workload that is too much for them to handle.

                <li>Group members who will be involved in the programming of the implementation phase should become familiar with the frameworks we plan to use ahead of time.

                <li>Compare our project with what has been accomplished in sample projects from previous years. If ours is a lot more complicated, consider which features are unnecessary and what can be removed.

                <li>Remember that the planning documents are all living documents -if, after writing them, we decide we won’t implement something we said we would, we can retroactively update previous documents. It is the job of the representatives of previous project phases to ensure the older documents are up to date with the current plan.

                The developers will use Discord and Github to stay organized and coordinated. Developers will use VSCode along with any required plugins to write the code itself and use git commands to push any changes to the main project. All developers will agree to write code in a consistent style regarding things like brackets, comments, and indentation. A set standard will be agreed upon and all written code will be reviewed to ensure the standards are met. The appropriate database management software will be used to store and manage the user data and a schema of the database will be generated in said software.

                The verification plan is to identify and ensure that features/activities establish abidance of the requirements.  Each features’ code will be tested by their original developers followed by another member of the development team and a final review given by a member of the software quality assurance team. Github will be used in order to track each document's revision history.
