## Overview
StudySpace is a web application that allows university students to create and find virtual study spaces to help them study and experience university together.

This application allows students to:

- Search for groups they are interested and join them
- Be able to make posts and ask questions within groups, which can be commented on

Furthermore the platform will have:
- Voice chats available for the different rooms
- Different chat rooms for international students and returning students
- An area to buy, sell, and ask questions about textbooks (marketplace)
- Mental health support (find individuals to talk to)

## What is the purpose of the project

This project allows university students to create and find virtual study spaces to help them study and experience university together. It uses a conceptual framework of desks which can be set to public or private. If students are using our application to complete a group project with a few designated members, then they can set the desk to private and collaborate privately. If desks are public, then anyone can join and work with everyone there, just like what would happen if a group of students were at a library. Each desk is temporary, and only lasts as long as people are using it. After everyone leaves, the desk is purged from memory. Each desk has an admin who can set the number of people, add signifiers such as language, age category, etc. Users can then sort desks by whatever preferences they have, or join whichever they want to. Sorting will require implementation of queries which will be implemented in the back end.

Premium Desk is a virtual desk for students who would like to buy services from a tutor. The tutor can be a student, professor, or a 3rd party tutor. Each tutor has their own page with their respective qualifications and an area to leave reviews. The premium desk can either be used between 1 tutor and 1 student, or 1 tutor and multiple students having the same difficulties. This feature will be categorized under the virtual tables, there will be free tables with other students or this paid desk.

Live chat rooms are a feature that will enable private discussions during lectures. When students feel like their questions are too “dumb” or do not understand the professor, they can join these live chat rooms to talk to other students in the same lecture. Students who feel more confident can also decide to ask these questions to the professor.
 
There will be a general discussion section that students at any institution can use to discuss general topics such as recreational activities, clubs, campus amenities, advice for adjusting to living alone, and much more.

Students will also be able to use an “Anonymous” feature that will allow them to post questions to a discussion board with complete privacy. This will allow for students to feel more comfortable asking their questions and getting the help they need. 

## Who is the audience?

Primarily students. We have subdivided these into the following categories:
- People writing exams wanting to study
