## Project Proposal

-   **Title:** StudySpace
-   **Start Date:** 01/15/2021
-   **End Date:** 04/12/2021

## Overview

StudySpace is a web application that provides university students with access to virtual study spaces and several other useful tools to help them succeed in school.

This application allows students to:

-   Create profiles and log-in
-   Get matched with like-minded peers to either establish a study group or find an individual study buddy. (Users are matched based on their hobbies, preferences, major, favourite subjects, etc.)
-   Manually search for and join study groups
-   Make posts and ask questions within groups, to which other users can reply

Additional features:

-   Voice chats available for chat rooms
-   Separate chat rooms dedicated to supporting international students and returning students
-   A public marketplace where users can create and inquire about listings for buying/selling textbooks
-   A dedicated forum for students to reach out to each other for mental health support

## What is the purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to give university students a sense of unity by providing them with several tools to meet new people, connect, and study together. StudySpace uses a conceptual framework of “desks” which can be made either private or public. If students are using our application to complete a group project with existing members, they can set the desk to private and collaborate privately. If a desk is public, anyone can join it and work with its members -just like they do in a physical library! Each desk is temporary -it only exists so long as people are using it. After everyone leaves the desk, it is purged from memory. Each desk has an admin who can set a limit to the number of members and add signifiers such as language, age category, etc. Users can sort desks based on their preferences, or join a random one.

### More Specific Features and Their Purposes:

Premium Desk is a virtual desk for students who would like to buy services from a tutor. The tutor can be a student, professor, or a 3rd party tutor. Each tutor has their own profile page with a display of their respective qualifications and an area for their reviews. The premium desk can either be used between 1 tutor and 1 student, or 1 tutor and multiple students having the same difficulties.

Live chat rooms are a feature that enables private, real-time discussions during lectures. If students are too embarrassed to ask a question or they do not understand the professor, they can join these live chat rooms to talk to other students in the same lecture.
There is a general discussion forum accessible to students from any university where they can discuss topics such as recreational activities, clubs, campus amenities, advice for adjusting to living alone, and much more.

Students can use the “Anonymous” feature, which allows them to anonymously post questions to a discussion board. This allows some students to feel more comfortable asking school-related questions or seeking advice/mental health support.

## Who is the audience?

-   Primarily students who fall into the following categories:

    -   Those wanting to study
    -   Individuals looking for special help related to their course
    -   Those looking to buy/sell textbooks
    -   Groups who are completing an assigned group project
    -   Are offering tutoring services or are looking for a tutor
    -   Individuals looking for general guidance or mental health support

-   Tutors, our project allows other tutors to effortlessly connect with other students; tutors would be able to find their clients with ease.

-   An indirect audience would be the school's tutor/study organizations such as MAC (Math Assistance Center) in Laurier's Lazardis Hall. Students would normally go to MAC to get help with Math related questions and work. With our project, students don't have to rely on the tutuors provided by the MAC to assist them with their courses. Since these organizations are usually packed and full of students, our project would create less 'pressure' on these organizations by re-directing students to other tutors that are not associated with the organziation.

-   An indirect audience would be the schools' board of directors. The school could gauge what study spaces are commonly used throughout the campus. This data could be used to decide if more study spaces should be built (or disassembeled) at a specific area; which inevitably also benefits the students.

## What are the benefits to the audience?

-   Saves time and effort in finding new people who have certain things in common with them
-   Helps them meet new people and create a network
-   Provides them with a unique virtual environment that fosters educational success
-   They can easily get help with course work
-   They can find a tutor/find students to tutor
-   Buy/sell textbooks easily
-   Access a network of individuals open to providing advice or guidance with mental health problems common to students
